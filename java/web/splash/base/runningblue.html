<h3>Running Blue</h3>

<p>
There are several options available to you when running Blue. One option is to use the start-up scripts provided with this download.
Contained within the ~bin/ directory of your download, start-blue.sh (unix) or start-blue.bat(windows) will get Blue and the Blue Console running for you. 
</p>
<p>
The startup script supports a few command line arguments to alter the way in which it runs.
Without any arguments the startup script will start the Blue Console and the Blue Configuration Tool only.
This allows you to manage the different components as seperate entities, or run Blue in a headless manner should you want to.</p>

<p>Using the -s option will cause the startup script to launch the Blue server as well.
Using -s in conjunction with -n will cause Blue to install an extremely basic configuration for you. This will get you up and running and monitoring your first host in no time. 
Using the -n option assumes that you have your plug-ins installed in $BLUE_HOME/libexec. If this is not the case then you must use the -p option to override this setting. For example should my plug-ins reside in /usr/local/blue-plugins,
I would start the server in the following way:<br/><br/>
<b>BLUE_HOME/start-blue.sh -s -i -p /usr/local/blue-plugins</b> for Unix users<br/>
<b>BLUE_HOME/start-blue.bat -s -i -p C:/cygwin/usr/local/blue-plugins</b> for Windows users.
<br/><br/>

The final option you can use with the startup script is -c. You can use this should you wish to use an already existing configuration (Perhaps you already have Nagios and are looking to try Blue). The -c option can be used in conjunction with the -s option to launch
the Blue server with an alternative configuration file i.e.<br/><br/>

<b>BLUE_HOME/start-blue.sh -s -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg</b> for Unix users<br/>
<b>BLUE_HOME/start-blue.bat -s -c c:/blue/etc/nagios.cfg for Windows users.</b>
</p>

<p>
There are several ways you can launch Blue outside of the startup script and these are available to suite your own needs.
Firstly you can call the .jar files directly from the command line. Using the following commands you can get the Blue Components up and running.
<br/>
<b>java -jar blue-server.jar <options> <path_to_config></b>
<br/><br/>

You can also use the -v switch with the above command to verify the contents of any configuration file you are intending to use. You can also use the -s switch to display current Blue scheduling information and recommendations. Using the 
-h switch with the above option will give you the ability to find out all available options to you.
</p>

<p>To start the Blue Console outside of the wrapper scripts, you will need to enter the following command<br/>

<br/><b>java -jar blue-console.jar</b><br/><br/>

This will start the Blue console at http://localhost:8080/blue and the Blue Configuration Tool at http://localhost:8080/blue-config should you have it installed.
</p>

<p>It should be noted that to launch Blue outside of the wrapper scripts in this manner, you will need to have the Java executable on your path.</p>
