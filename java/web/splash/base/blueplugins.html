<h3>Blue Plugins</h3>

<p>There are a number of Java plugins that are available with the first version of Blue. These plugins attempt to be faithful
ports of their Nagios counterparts and operate in a similar fashion. They all return exit codes indicating the status of the Host/Service
that they are being used to monitor, and they also all return a single line of output giving more information about their return status.</p>

<p>The Java plugins supplied with Blue at this stage all reside within the base directory of your Blue installation. Provided you have
Java installed, you can run all of the plugins from the command line using the following syntax:
	<ul>
		<li>java -jar plugin_name plugin_options</li>
	</ul>

All plugins should support being run with the -h option to give you more information on how to use them.</p>

<p>To use the Blue Java plugins with your Blue installation, you will need to define a command that instructs Blue to
launch the .jar file. We recommend that you also define a macro that points to the directory in which you have the Blue
Java plugins installed (if you have used the basic configuration provided by the startup scripts, this is done for you).
</p>

<p>Defining a command to use the Blue Java plugins should leave you with something similar to this:</p>
<p>define command{<br/>
	command_name	check_local_time<br/>
	command_line	java -jar $USER2$/blue-check-local-time.jar -H $ARG1$ -w $ARG2$ -c $ARG3$<br/>
}
</p>

<p>The above example assumes that you have defined a macro with id $USER2$ to point to the directory containing your Blue
plugins</p>

<p>You should attempt to keep the Blue plugins within the base directory of your Blue installation. If for any reason you 
are required to move the plugins, you will need to add the required .jar files from the ~lib directory of your Blue installation to your classpath.
The reason for this is that many of the plugins make use of libraries contained within the ~lib directory and the code for all current Blue plugins is stored
within the blue-plugins.jar file.</p>
