<h3>Plugin Development</h3>
<p>This page gives information on how to develop plugins for Blue. Plugins are the small executables that
allow Blue to run checks on different Hosts and Services. We have provided an initial amount of Blue Java
plugins that have attempted to be faithful ports of their Nagios counterparts. The advantage of Java plugins
over their Nagios counterparts is that they can be run on any system with Java installed, and they do not need
to be compiled for your individual system.</p>
<p>As discussed we have provided a basic complement of plugins that have been ported from their C counterparts (and more are to follow). However
you may wish to write your own plugins to increase the functionality of your Blue experience. The following instructions 
tell you how to do this</p>

<p>Contained within the ~lib directory of your Blue installation is blue-plugins.jar. This contains all
code for currently available Blue plugins. This .jar file also contains the base code that you will need
to begin developing your own plugins.</p>

<p>All Blue plugins extend the org.blue.plugins.check_base class. The check_base class is an abstract class meaning that it 
cannot be directly instantiated. You will need to provide a concrete implementation of the abstract methods 
that this class provides, all of which should be contained within the body of your plugin class.</p>

<p>There are several different abstract methods from the check_base class that you must override. The below list
provides definitions of the methods that you need to override and gives you an indication as to their basic operation.

<ul>
	<li><b>init_command()</b> - This allows you to prime the superclass with information about your plugin. The information you
	can pass to the super class includes elements such as super.progname and super.revision,super.copyright.</li><br/>
	<li><b>add_command_arguments(Options options)</b> - This is where you define the available parameters to your plugin. This method
	makes use of the Apache Commons CLI library and provides access to super.options . super.options is a collection of options
	added by default via the org.blue.plugins.check_base class, this includes default options that should appear with each plugin
	i.e. -h for help, -v for verbose.</li><br/>
	<li><b>process_command_option(Option o)</b> - This allows you to process the value of the option set by the user and configure your
	plugin accordingly.</li><br/>
	<li><b>process_command_arguments(String[] args)</b> - This allows you to process any command line values that were not caught by the 
	process_command_option method.</li><br/>
	<li><b>validate_command_arguments()</b> - This is where you sanity check the arguments that the user has passed. If there are incorrect
	options set for your plugin to work correctly, then this method should return false.</li><br/>
	<li><b>execute_check()</b> - This is the method in which you either have all the functionality that performs the check provided by your
	plugin, or you call other methods to provide the functionality for you.</li><br/>
	<li><b>check_message()</b> - This method is where you return the output of your plugin. This should be no more than one line of text.</li><br/>
	<li><b>check_state()</b> - This method is where you return the status of your plugin. This should either be common_h.OK,common_h.WARNING,
	common_h.CRITICAL or common_h.UNKNOWN based around the logic within your plugin.</li><br/>
</ul>

<p>Each plugin should also contain a single main method. Within this main method the plugin calls an instance of itself
to perform the checks i.e.:<br/><br/>

public static void main(String[] args)
{
	new check_ftp().process_request(args);
}
