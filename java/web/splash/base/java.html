<h3>Java Requirements:</h3>

<p>As Blue is written in Java, you will at least require the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for Blue to 
function properly. If you wish to develop your own plugins or extend the functionality that Blue 
offers, you will also require the Java Development Kit.</p>

<p>To install the JRE you will first need to download the latest version from the Website of Sun Microsystems.
You can download the latest JRE <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">here</a>. Blue has been
tested with JRE 1.6 and seems to work without issue. If you do not currently have Java installed then we recommend
that you install the latest version of the 1.6 JRE.</p>

<p>With Java installed, you will need to add it to your path to faciliate the easy operation of Blue. There are 
numerous documents that explain the concept of a path and how to alter it to suit your needs. The following
links explain how to alter your path under either the Windows or Unix environments:

	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm">Windows Path Information</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://kb.iu.edu/data/acar.html">Unix Path Information</a></li>
	</ul>

<p>If you currently have Java installed then Blue has been tested with Java 1.5 and above. It is currently not
compiled for the 1.4 JRE and therefore you should consider upgrading to meet these requirements.</p>
