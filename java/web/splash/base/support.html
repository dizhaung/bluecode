<p>Some common errors with Blue:<br/>

<ul>
	<li>When attempting to run the java -jar command i receive the following error<br/><br/>
	<b>java: command not found (*nix systems)</b><br/>

	<b>java is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. (Windows systems)</b>

<p>This is caused by the java executable not being on your path. For information onplacing the Java executable onto your path, please see the following links:

	<li><a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm">Windows Path Information</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://kb.iu.edu/data/acar.html ">Unix Path Information</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>
 
<li><b>When attempting to start the Blue Console I receive java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.mortbay.xml.XmlConfiguration.</b>
<p>
This is caused by the required libraries for Jetty not being on your Classpath. By default Jetty will check for the presence of these libraries within the ~lib directory relative to where the blue-console.jar is installed. To resolve the above issue you can perform one of the following:

<ul>
	<li> run the blue-console from within the console directory of $BLUE_HOME thus allowing Jetty to find the required .jar files from the ~lib directory</li>
	<li> add the jetty.jar and jetty-utils.jar jar files to your classpath.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</ul>
