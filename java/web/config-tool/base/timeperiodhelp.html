	<h3>Time Period Help</h3>
	<p>This page allows you to define Time Period objects within your Blue monitoring configuration. A Time Period object can be viewed as a definition
	of a period of time in which it is legal to perform Service and Host checks and send notifications. </p>
	
	<p>When defining a Time Period object, there are two required pieces of information. The information you must supply is as
	follows:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Time Period Name</b> - The name of this Time Period.</li>
			<li><b>Alias</b> - The alias of this Time Period.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>There are two valid syntaxes for definining a Time Period. As shown on the Time Period form, there is a begin and end period for each 
	day of the week. Each of these periods can be addressed in the following ways:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Begin:</b>09:00  <b>End</b>17:00</li>
			<li><b>Begin:</b>09:00-12:00  <b>End</b>15:00-20:00</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>In the first example, the Time Period is valid from 09:00 through to 17:00 without any breaks. In the second example, the Time Period is valid from
	09:00 until 12:00, and then from 15:00 until 20:00. This technique can be applied to each day of the week to create highly customised Time Periods. Should
	you not wish to have a valid Time on a certain day of the week, simply exclude that day from the Time Period definition.</p>
