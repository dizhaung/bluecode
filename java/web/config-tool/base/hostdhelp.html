	<h3>Host Dependency Help</h3>
	<p>This page allows you to define Host Dependency objects within your Blue monitoring configuration. Host Dependencies
	are a way of suppressing notifcations and active checks of Hosts based on the status of another Host. When defining a Host
	Dependency there are a number of different pieces of information that you need to provide:
	
		<ul>
			<li><b>Dependent Host Name</b> - This is the name of the Host on which we are dependent..</li>
			<li><b>Host Name</b> - The host that this dependency applies to.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<p>You can also specify whether or not this Dependency inherits the dependencies of the Host it is dependent on. Using this option, should
	any Hosts that the parent of this dependency is dependent on fail, then notifications and checks for this Host will also be supressed.</p>
	<p>By providing the Execution and Notification failure criteria, you prescribe the conditions of the dependent Host that will cause checks and
	notifications of the Host to be supressed.</p>
	
	<p>It should be noted that Host Escalations are an optional part of your monitoring setup.</p>
