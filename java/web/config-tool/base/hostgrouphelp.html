	<h3>Host Group Help</h3>
	<p>Host Groups allow you to logically group together one or more Host objects. Generally this information is used for display on the
	Blue Console, which gives you an overview of your Host monitoring situation. Host Groups can be useful when you have numerous Hosts that 
	perform synonymous tasks and can be thought of as a single entity i.e. All Database Servers.</p>
	<p>To define a Host Group you must provide the following information:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Group Name:</b> - The name of the Host Group</li>
			<li><b>Alias:</b> - The Alias of the Host Group</li>
			<li><b>Members:</b> - The Hosts that are to be members of this Host Group. This can be one or more Hosts.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
