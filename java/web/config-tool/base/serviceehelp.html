	<h3>Service Escalation Help</h3>
	<p>This page allows you to define Service Escalation objects within your Blue monitoring configuration. Service Escalations should be viewed
	as a way of escalating notifications should a Service be in a non-OK state for a certain period of time. For instance, if the Service is not
	OK and 10 warnings have been sent, then notify the management. When defining Service Escalations, there are several pieces of information you
	will need to provide:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Host Name</b> - The name of the Host on which this Service resides.</li>
			<li><b>Service Description</b> - The description of the Service on this Host.</li>
			<li><b>Contact Group</b> - The Contact group that should be notified as a result of this escalation.</li>
			<li><b>First Notification</b> - Identifies the number of notifications from which this escalation is effective.</li>
			<li><b>Last Notification</b> - Identifies the number of notifications from which this escalations ceases to be effective.</li>
			<li><b>Notification Interval</b> - The "time unit" interval in which notifications for this escalation should be sent.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<p>The first notification element defines the number of notifications that must have been sent before this Escalation becomes
	effective. For example, if 'First Notification' is set to 3 and 'Last Notification' is set to 5, this Escalation is only effective
	after 3 notifications have been sent, and until 5 notifications have been sent. You can also define the Time Period in which it is valid
	to send noitifications for this Escalation, and also the conditions under which this Escalation	is effective.</p>
	
	<p>It should be noted that Service Escalations are an optional part of your monitoring setup.</p>
