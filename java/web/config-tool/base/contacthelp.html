	<h3>Contact Help</h3>
	<p>This page allows you to define Contact objects within your Blue monitoring configuration. A Contact object should
	be viewed as a person that is notified when a event occurs on either a Host or Service object. You have the ability to 
	specify several pieces of information about the Contact including when and how they should be contacted.</p>
	
	<p>When defining a Contact object, there are several required pieces of information. The information you must supply is as
	follows:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Contact Name</b> - The name of this Contact.</li>
			<li><b>Alias</b> - The Alias of this Contact.</li>
			<li><b>Host Notification Period</b> - The Time Period in which it is valid to send Host Notifications to this Contact.</li>
			<li><b>Service Notification Period</b> - The Time Period in which it is valid to send Service Notifications to this Contact.</li>
			<li><b>Host Notification Options</b> - The conditions under which Host notifications will be sent to this Contact.</li>
			<li><b>Service Notification Options</b> - The conditions under which Service notifications will be sent to this Contact</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>When defining a Contact you also have the ability to specify email and pager contact information. This information can be used when specifying the
	commands to use to notify the Contact. For instance it is possible to use the email address of a Contact through the $EMAILADDRESS$ macro.</p>
