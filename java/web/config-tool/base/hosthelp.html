	<h3>Host Help</h3>
	<p>This page allows you to define Host objects within your Blue monitoring configuration. A Host object should
	be viewed as any physical device on your network. This obviously includes normal servers that provide services, but
	also extends to include other devices such as switches, routers, temperature monitoring systems etc.</p>
	<p>When defining a Host object, there are several required pieces of information. The information you must supply is as
	follows:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Hostname</b> - The name of this Host</li>
			<li><b>Alias</b> - An Alias for this Host</li>
			<li><b>IP Address</b> - The IP Address that this Host can be reached on.</li>
			<li><b>Max Check Attempts</b> - The number of times Blue will try to re-check this Host, should the check host Command not return OK.</li>
			<li><b>Check Period</b> - The Time Period in which it is valid to make active checks of this host.</li>
			<li><b>Notification Options</b> - This determines under what conditions notifications for this Host will be sent.</li>
			<li><b>Notification Interval</b> - This determines the number of "time units" to wait before re-notifying a Contact that the Host is still down.</li>
			<li><b>Notification Period</b> - This determines the Time Period in which it is valid to send Notifications.</li>
			<li><b>Contact Groups</b> - This is the Contact Group that should be notified for this Host.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Perhaps the other most important part of the Host configuration is selecting the Command to use for checking the Host. This Command will perform
	some functionality that allows Blue to be sure that the Host is still up and responsive. Host Checks are only performed on start up and then after
	any Service that runs on the Host returns a non-OK status. This is to verify that the Host is still responsive before notifications are sent for the
	Service.</p>
	<p>In order for checks to be completed and notifications to be sent, it is imperative that you have the 'Checks Enabled' option set and also
	the 'Notifications Enabled' option. Without these options set, Blue will not perform any checking of the Host nor send any notifications should
	the state of the Host change.</p>
	<p>Should an event occur on this Host, you can define what is known as an Event Handler. In effect an Event Handler consists of a Command that should be
	run after a certain event occurs. For instance you may wish to provide a command that sends Host monitoring information to a database after an event occurs.
	To utilise an Event Handler, you must firstly define a Command that performs the required functionality you wish to implement should an Event occur, and then set this to
	be the Event Handler for this Host. You must then ensure that the 'Event Handler Enabled' option is set.</p>
	<p> 
	<p>Other options available to you include storing the status data of this Host by ensuring that the 'Retain Status Data' options are ticked. You can also specify
	thresholds for flapping on this Host. For a detailed explanation of flapping, please refer to the main Blue Documentation.</p>
