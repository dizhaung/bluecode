	<h3>Service Group Help</h3>
	<p>Service Groups allow you to logically group together one or more Service objects. Generally this information is used for display on the
	Blue Console, which gives you an overview of your Service monitoring situation and the relationships between the Hosts they are monitored on.
	Service Groups can be useful when you have numerous Services that perform synonymous tasks and can be thought of as a single entity
	i.e. All Disk Space checks.</p>
	<p>To define a Service Group you must provide the following information:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Group Name:</b> - The name of the Service Group</li>
			<li><b>Alias:</b> - The Alias of the Service Group</li>
			<li><b>Members:</b> - The Services that are to be members of this Service Group. This can be one or more Services.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
