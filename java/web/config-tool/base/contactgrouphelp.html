	<h3>Contact Group Help</h3>
	<p>Contact Groups allow you to logically group together one or more Contact objects. Generally this information is used for display on the
	Blue Console, which gives you an overview of your Contacts. Contact groups are also used to notify numerous Contacts should certain events 
	occur on either Host or Service objects. You will notice that when you define a Host or Service object, you will need to specify the Contact
	Group that should be notified after an event occurs on that Service/Host. As a Contact group can consist of one or more Contacts, all Contacts
	contained within the Contact group will be notified after the event has occurred.</p>
	<p>To define a Contact Group you must provide the following information:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Group Name:</b> - The name of the Contact Group</li>
			<li><b>Alias:</b> - The Alias of the Contact Group</li>
			<li><b>Members:</b> - The Contacts that are to be members of this Contact Group. This can be one or more Contacts.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
