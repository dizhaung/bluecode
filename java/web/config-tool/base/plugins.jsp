<h3>Plugin Management</h3>
<p>
	Blue Plugins are the scripts and binaries that provide the ability to monitor a variety of different services and hosts. This
	page helps to manage the plugins that are installed as part of your Blue configuration. Here you can create new services and hosts
	based around the plugins that you already have installed. You can also search for and install new plugins from the central repository. Finally you can
	give back to the Blue community by uploading any plugins that you have written yourself that you believe others may find useful.	
</p>

<p>This functionality is not present within the 0.1 Beta of this Configuration Tool.</p>
