	<h3>Host Extended Info Help</h3>
	<p>This page allows you to define Host Extended Info objects within your Blue monitoring configuration. Host Extended Info objects really
	provide no functionality other than to make the representation of your Hosts within the Blue Console look better. You can also attach further
	information to a Host through the use of action and notes URLs that can point to other websites. When defining Host Extended Info, you must
	provide the following information: 
	
		<ul>
			<li><b>Host Name</b> - The name of the Host that this Host Extended Info applies to.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<p>You have the ability to specify several pieces of information to improve the view of your Host information. For instance you can specify notes to
	be used in conjunction with the Notes URL, and also give a new icon to a Host to make it more clearly identifiable within the Blue Console.</p>
	
	<p>It should be noted that Host Extended Information is an optional part of your monitoring setup.</p>
