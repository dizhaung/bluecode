	<h3>Configuration Tool Info.</h3>
	
	<p>This tool allows you to manage your Blue Configuration over time, hopefully making it easier to add/modify and remove different 
	elements of your monitoring setup.</p>
	<p>This tool creates two sets of output when you are using it. The first is the Blue configuration files that should be used to start
	your instance of Blue. The main Blue configuration file is aptly named blue.cfg and will appear in the directory that you specified 
	for storing your output files. You should use this file to start Blue with the configuration that you have built, see the further Blue
	documentation on how to do this if you are unsure.</p>
	<p>The second set of output generated by this tool is a set of XML documents that are used to store the details of your configuration. 
	The tool makes use of XML documents in conjunction with Blue configuration files, as it makes it easier to traverse and update the information
	related to your configuration. The XML documents will appear within the XML directory of the location you specified to contain your main configuration
	files. It is important that this directory is not deleted as the tool will loose all knowledge of your current monitoring setup. I therefore suggest that you
	backup this configuration information on a semi-regular basis, or at least after every set of changes have been made.</p>
	<p>Should your configuration be accidentally deleted, providing you still have the Blue version of the configuration files, you can use this tool to re-import
	the configuration information and this will generate the XML for you again.</p>
