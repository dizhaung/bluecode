	<h3>Service Dependency Help</h3>
	<p>This page allows you to define Service Dependency objects within your Blue monitoring configuration. Service Dependencies
	are a way of suppressing notifcations and active checks of Services based on the status of another Service. When defining a Service
	Dependency there are a number of different pieces of information that you need to provide:
	
		<ul>
			<li><b>Dependent Host Name</b> - This is the name of the Host on which the dependent Service runs.</li>
			<li><b>Dependent Service Description</b> - This is the description of Service on whose status we shall depend.</li>
			<li><b>Host Name</b> - The name of the Host on which the Service runs.</li>
			<li><b>Service Description</b> - The description of the Service that we would like to make dependent.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<p>You can also specify whether or not this Dependency inherits the dependencies of the Service it is dependent on. Using this option, should
	any Services that the parent of this dependency is dependent on fail, then notifications and checks for this Service will also be supressed.</p>
	<p>By providing the Execution and Notification failure criteria, you prescribe the conditions of the dependent Service that will cause checks and
	notifications of the Service to be supressed.</p>   
	
	<p>It should be noted that Service Dependencies are an optional part of your monitoring setup.</p>
