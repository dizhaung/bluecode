	<h3>Service Extended Info Help</h3>
	<p>This page allows you to define Service Extended Info objects within your Blue monitoring configuration. Service Extended Info objects really
	provide no functionality other than to make the representation of your Services within the Blue Console look better. You can also attach further
	information to a Service through the use of action and notes URLs that can point to other websites. When defining Service Extended Info, you must
	provide the following information: 
	
		<ul>
			<li><b>Host Name</b> - The name of the Host on which this Service resides.</li>
			<li><b>Service Description</b> - The Description of the Service on the above Host.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<p>You have the ability to specify several pieces of information to improve the view of your Service information. For instance you can specify notes to
	be used in conjunction with the Notes URL, and also give a new icon to the Service to make it more clearly identifiable within the Blue Console.</p>
	
	<p>It should be noted that Service Extended Information is an optional part of your monitoring setup.</p>
